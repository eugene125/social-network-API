## Description

The purpose of the Social Media API assignment was to allow a user to manage information about users of a social media platform utilizing a Mongo database. The initial seeding of the database is done though a seeding file, but additional data can be added as needed. With no developed front end, the user interacts with the database through insomnia.

## Set Up

- Clone the repository to your local machine
- Install local dependencies
    * Install npm: "npm install" 
- If manual installation is needed:
    * express: "npm install express"
    * mongoose: "npm install mongoose"
- Enter "npm run seed" to seed the database
- Enter "npx nodemon" to start up the server
